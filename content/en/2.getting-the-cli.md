## Introduction

Once your dico is created on [ui.dico.app](https://ui.dico.app) the workflow for developers becomes centered around the CLI.

## Installing the CLI

To get the CLI, simply install it with your favorite package manager:

<d-code-group>
  <d-code-block label="NPM" active>

```bash
npm install --global @dico/cli
```

  </d-code-block>
  <d-code-block label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn global add @dico/cli
```

  </d-code-block>
</d-code-group>

Once installed, the command `dico` should now be available globally.

<d-alert type="info">

ðŸ’¡ Typing `dico` in your terminal should result in the CLI help message being displayed.

</d-alert>

## Logging In

Now that you have the CLI you need to authenticate within it.

For that purpose you'll need your personal access token. To get this token check the personal access token section of your user profile within [ui.dico.app](https://ui.dico.app).

Once you have your token simply use the login command, replacing `<token>` with your personal access token:

<dico-login-cli></dico-login-cli>

<d-alert type="info">

ðŸ’¡ If you're currently logged in within [ui.dico.app](https://ui.dico.app), you should see above your very own personal access token!

If so, you can then simply copy/paste the command.

</d-alert>

If everything went well, you're not logged in!
