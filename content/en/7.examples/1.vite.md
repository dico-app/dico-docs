This guide assumes you already have common knowledge about Dico.app from the [getting started](/) section.

Once you have [installed the client](/installing-the-client) on your project, it might appear to you that dico feels a bit too _magical_ to work perfectly out of the box.

Let's make it a little less _magical_ by creating a [composable](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/composition-api-introduction.html) for your project.

Start updating your `dico.js` content as follows:

```javascript[src/dico.(js|ts)]
import { reactive } from "vue";

import { createDico } from "@dico/client";
import data from "../dico.data.json";

export const { $dico, $dicoI18n } = createDico(data);

export const useDico = () => {
	return {
		$dico: $dico,
		$dicoI18n: reactive($dicoI18n)
	};
};
```

Notice that we only make `$dicoI18n` reactive, the reason for that is that the `$dico` object is already reactive to `$dicoI18n` and doesn't need to be reactive to anything else as you cannot set its value.

From here you can then use your new composable inside Vue components:

```html[src/**/*.vue]
<template>
	<div> {{ $dico.myFirstCollection.hello }} | {{ $dicoI18n.currentLocale }}</div>
	<button @click="$dicoI18n.setLocale($dicoI18n.locales['en-us'])">en-us</button>
	<button @click="$dicoI18n.setLocale($dicoI18n.locales['fr-fr'])">fr-fr</button>
</template>

<script>
import { useDico } from "./dico";

export default {
	setup() {
		const { $dico, $dicoI18n } = useDico();

		return { $dico, $dicoI18n }
	}
}
</script>
```

You're done! You can check out [the example repository of that project ->](https://github.com/dico-app/dico-example-vite)

Alternatively you can also go further by browser the references for the [CLI and the client](/references/cli) ->
