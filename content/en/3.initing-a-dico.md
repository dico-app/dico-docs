To init a dico, make sure you first have at least a dico on [ui.dico.app](https://ui.dico.app).

## Initing `dico.config.json`

Initing a dico is pretty straightforward and consists of creating a [`dico.config.json`](/references/glossary#dicoconfigjson---dico-config-file) file at the root of your project directory. No worries! We have a command to help you with that process:

```bash
dico init
```

The [CLI init command](/references/cli#init) will check for available dicos you have access to as a _developer_ or _admin_ ([you need to be logged in](/getting-the-cli#logging-in))

It'll then prompt you to pick one and will create the corresponding `dico.config.json` file. This file is meant to be versioned on git, it primarily contains information about your dico [structure](/glossary#structure).

Once your `dico.config.json` file is created the CLI will prompt you for installing `@dico/client` for you. Picking yes to this options allows you to skip the next section, [installing the client](/installing-the-client), and to go straight to [writing keys](/writing-keys).

Now that your dico is inited within your project, you can head to [installing the client](/installing-the-client). If the init process already did so for you, you can go straight to [writing keys ->](/writing-keys)
