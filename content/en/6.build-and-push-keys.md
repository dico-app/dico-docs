Whenever you're done [writing keys](/writing-keys), you can then build and push your changes to Dico.app.

## Building Your Dico

Before pushing keys to Dico.app you first need to build your dico. To do so you need to use the CLI at your project root:

```bash
dico build
```

The [CLI build command](/references/cli#build) will crawl your project files looking for keys. It'll then build your [dico structure](/references/glossary#structure) out of the found keys. If there's any issue during this process the CLI will let you know.

<d-alert type="info">

ðŸ’¡ Your source code is not in the `src` folder or the build command doesn't detect any key? Try editing the `sources` array in your `dico.config.json` file with [patterns](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#usage) matching your source files.

Still having issues? Checkout the [common mistakes](/writing-keys#common-mistakes) when creating keys.

</d-alert>

## Pushing Keys

Once your dico is built you can then push it to Dico.app. As you might have guessed already, you can use the [CLI push command](/references/cli#push) to do so:

```bash
dico push
```

If everything went well your dico on [ui.dico.app](https://ui.dico.app) should now allow you to browse and edit your new keys!

ðŸ’¡ Tired of building and pushing your dico together? You can run the push command with the build flag to perform both at once: `dico push --build`
